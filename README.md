## what it does

a super simple app that allows you to write poems, and place lines anywhere on the page, recreating the freedom of typing on a typewriter.

## usage

Visit the app [here](https://nickk00324.github.io/doth).
Double click to add a new line,
Single click and drag to move the line on the page.
click the 'capture' button to create a png image of your poem, right-click to save.
print button opens a print dialogue, save as pdf for pdfs.
horizontal and vertical draggable guides, make sure you hide them before capturing, unless you want them there?
it's best to not resize the window while working because of the way i calculated positions, it makes
the placements all wonky

## Upcoming features

- sync with google drive to save pdfs 
- settings to customize things such as page size and fonts
- some kind of sync with instagram to make it easier to post there
- accounts where you can save your poems
- some sort of refactor where positioning isn't so finicky 
- improvements to the mobile version :P
